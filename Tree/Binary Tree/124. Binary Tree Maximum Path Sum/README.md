# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

###### Tag: Binary Tree, DFS

This problem searches for the max path sum in a binary tree. A valid path inside a tree has three forms : 1. Only left path 2. Only right path 3. left + right path with node vertex.
Imagine we are in the current level of a tree, the max path sum ends at current node is the max between the three forms.
