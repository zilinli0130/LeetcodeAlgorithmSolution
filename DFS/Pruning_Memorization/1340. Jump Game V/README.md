# 1340. Jump Game V

###### Tag: DFS, Memorization
This is a DFS problem by using memorization to prune DFS tree branches. Memorization template can refer to [329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://github.com/zilinli0130/Leetcode_Algorithm/tree/main/DFS/Pruning_Memorization/329.%20Longest%20Increasing%20Path%20in%20a%20Matrix).
The memorization can reduce the time complexity to O(N) where N is the length of input array.
