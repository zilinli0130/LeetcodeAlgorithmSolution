# kth Smallest Value in Sorted Matrix

###### Tag: Binary Search

Given a random element x in the sorted matrix, the number of elements which are less than or equal to x is n. If n < k, it means that the element x is too large to meet the kth
smallest element in a sorted matrix. If n >= k, it means that the element x might be a potential kth smallest element in a sorted matrix. We can use binary search to optimize this value.
