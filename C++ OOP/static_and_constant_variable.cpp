/*
1. Static variables must be initialized before the program starts
2. Variables that can be evaluated at compile time (those initialized by a constant expression) are const-initialized
3. All other static variables are zero-initialized during static initialization

4. constexpr forces the evaluation of a variable as a constant expression and implies const
5. constinit forces the evaluation of a variable as a constant expression and doesnâ€™t imply const
6. After static initialization dynamic initialization takes places, which happens at runtime before main()
7. const can be initialized (gives a variable an initial value at the point ) and evaluated (gives a variable a different value after creation) at 
   compiler time or run time
